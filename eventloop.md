Here is a list of things I wrote down while watching:

what is?
 single threaded
 run time
 v8
 call stack
 heap
 dom


 I know that!
  API

I figured out everything from the video and googled DOM.

It did a really good job of explaining why blinged out myspace pages always crashed on my browser. Since coding is man communicating with machine and javascript is how browsers communicate it's a bad idea to have your javascript make huge stacks that will slow things down. I had no idea what an event loop was before and I can safely say I can explain it someone now if they ask.
